Members: Joah De Vries, Landon Hammond,  Michael Knudsen, Cody Lockridge
## Explanation
This application is a calculater for base 4, or quaternary, numbers. It functions largely similar to a standard base 10 calculator in that it can add, subtract, multiply, and divide. It can also find the square and square root of number all in base 4. The way it works logically is by converting input from base 4 into base 10, performing standard calculations, and then reconverting the solution back into base 4 to be displayed to the user.

## How to Use
Lauch Application, Use follows similarly to most calculator apps
CC Button to clear display and reset Calculation
Calculator can not be used when toggled into decimal mode.
